## What is `burstgridgo`?

BurstGridGo is an open-source experiment on its way to becoming a **production-grade automation and orchestration engine** ‚Äî a declarative system built in Go for developers who care about clarity, scalability, and modern engineering principles.  
It blends **declarative design**, **visual control**, and **AI-native automation** to help engineers define and orchestrate complex workflows with precision and insight.  
The project‚Äôs long-term mission is to turn today‚Äôs experimentation into tomorrow‚Äôs reliable platform.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Refined Strategic Pillars

1. **Declarative Core**  
   Define *what* to run, not *how*. The engine builds and executes the DAG automatically from clear, type-safe HCL.

2. **Modular Ecosystem**  
   A free, open marketplace for reusable modules ‚Äî from HTTP and gRPC to AI/LLM runners ‚Äî designed for easy discovery and contribution.

3. **Human-Grade Experience**  
   Power users get a rich **TUI**; everyone else gets a **Figma-quality Web UI** with drag-and-drop workflow design, live logs, and visual scaling.

4. **Scalable Architecture**  
   Built to handle both local runs and distributed workloads, scaling seamlessly across cores or clusters for load testing or orchestration.

5. **AI-Native Automation**  
   BurstGridGo will bridge traditional automation with intelligent systems ‚Äî integrating directly with modern AI protocols (MCP, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) and providing declarative control over AI tools and agents.

6. **Observability & Insight**  
   First-class analytics, logging, and reporting.  
   - Native support for **OpenTelemetry**, **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, and **Elastic Stack** for metrics and traces.  
   - Pluggable exporters so users can stream data to tools like **Datadog**, **New Relic**, or **OpenSearch**.  
   - Built-in reports and visual insights accessible from both the TUI and Web UI.

7. **Embeddable SDK**  
   Use BurstGridGo as a library within Go projects to orchestrate internal tasks or integrate directly into CI/CD and infrastructure workflows.

## üöÄ Getting Involved

Right now, BurstGridGo is focused on **contributors**.  
If you want to explore, learn, or help me shape the engine as it evolves ‚Äî start here:

üëâ **Read the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)** to understand how the project is structured, how to run it locally, and where your input can make the biggest difference.

This stage is about **building the foundation** ‚Äî architecture, testing, documentation, and modules.  
Every contribution helps move BurstGridGo closer to becoming the platform I envision.
