**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note: Project Status ‚ö†Ô∏è**

This project is currently under active development. The API and internal architecture are **not yet stable** and are subject to breaking changes. This project is not recommended for external production use; it is a POC (proof of concept).

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note: Project Status ‚ö†Ô∏è**



`burstgridgo` is a Go-native, declarative load testing tool for simulating real-world, protocol-aware workflows(grids) using HCL.

## Core Features
* **‚úÖ Declarative Programming**: Define complex, multi-protocol grids in simple, composable HCL files. 
* **‚úÖ Unified Configuration**: The loader treats all `.hcl` files from all paths recursively as a single collection. It imports all your definitions. No need imports. 
* **‚úÖ Ideological Concurrent and .....**: The builds a dependency graph (DAG) from all grids, running independent tasks in parallel, controlling the flow of execution and deps resolution. Dependencies are inferred automatically from variable usage.
* **‚úÖ Extensible by Design**: Missing a runner? It is a simple to add your own one. Welcome to contribute. is built on a simple Go `Module` interface. Implement your own logic and immediately use it as a module in your grid.
* **‚úÖ Minimal setup to start**: There is only one depency to start project quickly - docker. If you want more comfortable environment then `make` help you, or for fully local development you need `go` toolkit. Any of them works anyways.

## Example Grid
The following grid defines a workflow with multiple dependent HTTP requests.
```hcl
# File: examples/http_concurrent_requests.hcl

step "http_request" "httpbin" {
  count = 10

  concurrency {
    limit = 3
  }

  retry {
    attempts = 2
    delay    = 2s
  }

  arguments {
    url = "https://httpbin.org/get?$request={count.index}"
  }
}

step "print" "wait_each" {
  arguments {
    input = "Request=${count.index} code=${http_request.httpbin[each].output.status_code}"
  }
}

step "print" "wait_all" {
  arguments {
    input = "We made ${count(http_request.httpbin.output)} requests!"
  }
}
```


## How to run
Prerequisites: **Docker** and **Make**.


### Production (coming soon)

#### docker
```sh
docker run .... 
```

#### compose
```yaml

```

#### other method
```
What can be here?
```

### Development
To run a grid for development with live-reloading in docker.

Note: You need to pull the repository first and run it from repository. Because it injects the code from current folder.
, use the following command:
```sh
# Start local dev environment 
make dev grid=examples/http_request.hcl
```

### üß≠ Project Roadmap

1. ‚úÖ (Jul 27 2025) - Project start
2. üöß (In progress) - POC Preview v0.1-dev
2. üí° (Planned) - POC Preview v0.2-dev
2. üí° (Planned) - POC Preview v0.3-dev

### Features
*(‚úÖ Implemented | üöß In Progress | üí° Planned)*

* **‚úÖ Foundation for POC**:
  * ‚úÖ CLI
  * ‚úÖ HCL loading
  * ‚úÖ DAG Graph building
  * ‚úÖ Concurent Execution
  * ‚úÖ Dependencies
    * ‚úÖ Fan in
    * ‚úÖ Fan out
    * ‚úÖ Inmplicit/Explicit
  * ‚úÖ HCL Expressions
  * ‚úÖ Docker image
  * ‚úÖ Basic modules support
  * ‚úÖ Type System & Validation
    * ‚úÖ **Primitives:** `string`, `number`, `bool`
        * ‚úÖ **Collections:** `list(T)`, `map(T)`, `set(T)` where `T` is one of the primitive types.
        * ‚úÖ **Objects:**
            * ‚úÖ **`object({key=type, ...})`**: A structurally-typed object that maps to a Go `struct`.
            * ‚úÖ **`object({})`**: A generic object that maps to a Go `map[string]any`.
  * Looger
* **‚úÖ Extensible Runner/Asset Architecture**: The system for defining stateless `runners` and stateful `assets` via HCL manifests and registering their Go implementations is complete. (See `ADR-001`)
* **‚úÖ Stateful Resource Management**: The full lifecycle for `resource` blocks‚Äîincluding creation, destruction, and sharing instances between steps via the `uses` block‚Äîis implemented.
* **‚úÖ Pluggable & Unified Configuration**: The configuration loading system has been refactored to be format-agnostic. It now treats all `.hcl` files as a single, unified collection, allowing definitions and instances to be co-located. (See `ADR-007`)
* **‚úÖ Fail-Fast Execution**: The executor correctly cancels all running tasks as soon as one node fails, ensuring rapid feedback on errors.
* **‚úÖ Containerized Development Environment**: A multi-stage `Dockerfile` and `Makefile` provide a one-command setup for a live-reloading development environment (`make dev`).
* **‚úÖ Core Internal Refactoring**: The application has been successfully refactored into decoupled internal packages (`app`, `cli`, `config`, `hcl`, `dag`, `executor`) for improved maintainability. (See `ADR-002`)
* **‚úÖ Comprehensive Integration Test Suite**: A robust integration test suite is in place, validating core HCL features, concurrency patterns, and error handling. (See `ADR-003`)
* Release system
* **üí° External Module System**: Revisit the module system to allow for dynamic, third-party module registration.
* **üí° Dynamic Workflows & Meta-Arguments**: Full support for HCL features like `count`, `for_each`, and and additional logic (meta-arguments) to create multiple instances of steps and resources from a single configuration block. This includes support for four key dependency patterns:
    * **All-to-One**: A step can wait for all instances in a collection to complete (e.g., by referencing the collection's `output`).
    * **One-to-One (Templating)**: A step can be implicitly cloned to run for each instance in a collection (e.g., using an `[each]` reference).
    * **Specific-to-One**: A step can wait for a single, specific instance from a collection (e.g., via a direct index like `[3]`).
    * **Any-to-One (Race)**: A step can wait for just the first instance in a collection to complete (e.g., via a special `first_output` attribute).
* Declarative validation
  * BLOBS
  * REGEX
* **Conditional Execution**: Add an `if` meta-argument to conditionally skip the execution of a step or resource based on a boolean expression.
* **Concurrency Limiting**: Implement a `concurrency {}` block to limit the number of simultaneous executions within a `count` or `for_each` loop.
* **Execution Delays**: Introduce `delay_before` and `delay_after` meta-arguments to pause execution for a specified duration before or after a step runs.
* **Execution Timeouts**: Add a `timeouts {}` block to enforce a maximum execution time for any given step or resource.
* **Automatic Retries**: Introduce a `retry {}` block to automatically re-run a failed step with a configurable number of attempts and delay.
* **Global Variables**: Allow passing global variables into a run via CLI flags, such as `-var 'key=value'` and `-var-file="path/to/vars.hcl"`.
* **Definition Scoping**: Introduce a `scope` meta-argument (`local`, `module`, `global`) on `runner` and `asset` definitions to control their visibility and prevent naming collisions across files and folders.
* **Sensitive Data Handling(PII)**: Add a `sensitive = true` flag to input and output definitions to ensure secret values (like passwords or API keys) are redacted from all logs.
* **Insights & Reporting**
  * **üí° Native OpenTelemetry (OTLP) Export**: Add first-class support for exporting traces and metrics to OTLP-compatible backends like Jaeger or Honeycomb.
  * **üí° Live Terminal UI (TUI)**: Build an interactive terminal dashboard for a real-time view of test execution, including throughput, latency, and errors. (See `ADR-004`)
  * **üí° DAG Visualization Command**: Implement a `bggo graph` command to output a visual representation of the execution graph (e.g., in Mermaid or DOT format).
  * **üí° Prometheus Metrics Endpoint**: Provide an optional `/metrics` endpoint for scraping performance data during a test run.


* **Modules**
  * **Utilities**:
    * ‚úÖ `env_vars`

    * **üí° `s3` basic file upload**:
    * Expand beyond pre-signed URLs to support standard S3 API actions (`put_object`, `get_object`, `delete_object`, `list_objects`) using credentials.
    * Refactor to use the shared `http_client` asset for connection reuse.
